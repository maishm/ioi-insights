"from the Elmina masterplan, it seems that Ariza is not part of the Elmina Garden.So, is Ariza also entitled for Perimeter Fencing?Correct me if i am wrong...",1
I think the price is for end unit. Not for intermediate unit. But if the price is correct...wowllaaaaaa ðŸ‘ðŸ˜„,1
yeah....!!! further increase our property value,1

"I was at my house, phase 2 Keana during a heavy rain last month. Found out that Rain water was flowing down directly from the roof of room 1 upstairs onto the roof of the wet kitchen below. Did a survey from outside the back of the house. Discovered that there was no gutter and downpipe to discharge the rain!",0
"Yes, Elmina West should be their main project next year as that is their biggest piece of land - lots of DSL coming up in Elmina West according to the comments earlier from some forummers but if price starting from 600K+ onwards for a 20x60 DSL, then susah to sell in this slow market!600k for landed, sure finish internal, sound like elmina east first phase",1
"no, the chart for elmina west, this one is elmina east which not in the master plan (from the previous elmina east brochure)I see, I think SDP is planning to categorize East as premium and west as slightly lower range?",0
"I see, I think SDP is planning to categorize East as premium and west as slightly lower range?there have no such thing in selangor, every township development must have low cost, medium low cost, medium cost",0
Hi. I m new here.What s d different between Elmina West and East. Budget 720k. Can get?Anymore new phase here?,1
I think there are many bought for investmentI wonder what is the original selling price frm developer?,1
I bought for 745k. The owners wouldn't budge any lower but their unit was the best location for me. So i took it.There was 1 unit owner willing to sell at 728k. But in front is a vacant land. Heard future will have a mosque there.Another selling for 730k but facing junction. And 1 more selling for 735k but facing vacant land which will be future school.,1
"Your calculation is very prudent as you have factored a higher cost so actual profit is more.Whichever way you look at it, 100K investment to return 56K in 2 years is better than FD of 4% p.a.",1
24x79 is Keana I guess. But also must see budget too. haizz. let me consider first.,1
did you visit the 24x79 before made the purchase?,0
"This dead chicken is the hot issue in BR, now the wind sweeping to Elmina as well?",0
"Exactly what I thought, Ariza they whacked a lot right? 50% +?At least 50k nett profit if they sell now.",1
I guess balloting process still apply for the SDP new launching except property price exceed 1 Mil. The best thing is SDP pay for MOT and SNP legal fee for the new launching so new purchaser save about RM20K for house price RM650K++.,1
Could anyone kindly let me know where is Elmina's sales gallery? It is sharing the same sales gallery of Denai Alam? TQ.,1

"Share with u guys why I buy a unit in elmina.1. Developer - sime darby property -- I know sime darby property is not better than eco world and not the best but it not the worse. At least it able to deliver and hand over the house on time and it wont run away and become a abandon project.2. Quality - I know sime darby property didnt deliver the super quality product but at least it not the worse and the quality still can acceptable. (eg I stay in putra heights and it consider not bad compare with other deverloper). I know they should improve the qualaty but too bad they didnt.3. Location - just with 20 mins to one utama. - near kwasa damanasara, kota damanasara, pj, ara damasara - I got an option to use the road without paying a toll - easy access to highway - new highway is on the way - DASH (not sure the 100% can build on time) - near sg buloh MRT4. Trafic jam - which area not jam?5. Freehold property - I have staying in leasehold and freehold property, some of u may say is the same but I have experience when I sell my leasehold condo and the price appreciation on for freehold is alway faster and higher than leasehold.6. compare with new township - elmina vs Rimbayu, ecohill, eco xxxx in kota kementing and eco xxx in syemyih, elmina is still better in term of location.7 price - pricing for new township elmina vs rimbayu, ecohill, eco xxxx kota kementing/syemyih, ecohill in term of location, leasehold vs freehold. elmina still better.Agreed with u.

Maybe the price SA told me (RM7xxk) are the price after 7% Bumi discount. Not sure,1
"if the starting price mentioned is RM809,888 before discount, then this is consider as cheaper than Phase 2 in terms of price per sqft. Which means, for new owner, better to grab this unit as compared to Phase 2 (100% sold out already)Reason is, the smallest size for type B intermediate (22x75) is 2,369sqft. While Phase 2 Type A the intermediate unit is 1,855sqft at RM645,888. Therefore, for Phase 2 Type A price per sqft is RM348.19Considering of the price per sqft in Elmina Valley for Phase 1 and Phase 2 assumed is maintained at RM348.19 per sqft, then the Phase 3 Type B intermediate size 22x75 at 2,369 sqft price should be at RM824,888 (SD always like 888 at the last 3 digits).If the price is RM809,888 before discount then the price per sqft is RM341.87.

This means Garinia sub sale price is $370psf. Let's compare with the upcoming EV3 22x75 nb price from $790k with bu 2369sf or $333psf. Which one more worthy?,1
"Another con for Garinia is the units are mostly facing east/west.Any idea what is the rebate & sales package of EV3? If not mistaken EV1 gave 2% rebate, free SPA legal fee & MOT.",1
Ya lor. Last time along LDP also got no shopping mall,1
"The cheapest 5 units @ $793,888 facing kindy all habis sapu today. Other than that, still plenty of units to cherry-pick.By all means, pls go ahead if u really like this place, especially for own stay. EV3 psf price consider okay compare to the other earlier phases in EG & EV. As for investment, I personally think should enter at later stage.",1
My 'feel' is prices in Elmina won't appreciate much in the near term due to prevalent market sentiment and lack of commercial element. It is still at its early development stage. Best to enter when it reaches the high growth stage although prices would be a higher by then.,0
Hows the sales update for EV3? Seems quiet here..,0

hence why its not attractive enough for ppl to move in now... even places like puncak alam also have basic commercial activities within 5 mins driving radius... i expect this area to grow faster than PA actually.... but the general township concept and the house also very nice... like it.... its just the commercials abit slow for now...,0

"Certainly this is not cheap, investing 1.1mio property without full G&G for some people, but can you get another same type of property with same land size and buildup size else where in KV with this pricing. I didn't ask the SA how many unit they have sold last week but I think they will able to sell all in 3-4 months time, based on 70% unit taken at Tiana semi phase just within 4-5 months.",0
Oh F&G yes.,0
I see. How is d environment in E.G there? I'm concerning d distance go out for makan or buying stuff.,0
"Not really far lah, distance between subang airport to Elmina SDP office only 9.5km. It's 31.5km from Bdr Kinrara BK4 to SDP office, my usual travel time is about 30min via kesas-elite-gce. When DASH ready you can reach KL center within 40min and within 30-35 min to ikea or 1U.",1
Usually house prices will be lower than market value for lications with higher bumi quota. This is to allow higher participation.So Elmina prices cheap?,1
Elmina dsl all exceed 700k+? Too pricey tot of sapu-ing a unit here since sdp is putting a lot of effort here,1
"By that time, Elmina, currently link to Denai Alam - will be interconnected with another huge development, and will have access to MRT",1
it will be less than 5km after persiaran atmosfera extend to kwasa then persiaran jati (kota damansara)http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/gada...kwasa-damansaraThe proposed development is accessible through Persiaran Atmosfera and will in the future be connected to the Guthrie highway.,1
I don't think it's really a premium for elmina.What's stopping me is basically the additional upfront payment I have to make to secure the property.I rather invest the money elsewhere dulu while waiting compared to paying up and starting from scratch again.Location of Elmina is actually very nice and strategic for me.,0
Wah for big taikor like u of cos 700+k is nt premium price!Wat additional upfront payment? 30% downpayment for 3rd prop onwards? If u want d unit no choice but to pay d 30% upfront lo,1
"Cost for construction material, cost for labour and cost for land conversion is going up every year. I don't think KV landed property prices will stagnate and drop in near future therefore I think SDP will increase their property price by few % each new launch especially in Elmina west.",1
May I know buyer of which phase you are ?,1
"This may be an odd question, but what about dog ownership in Elmina? It's under Shah Alam, so you already have to deal with their stringent requirements. If the RA or neighbors want to be difficult, then die lor.Not gonna buy a place then be told I have to give up my dog to live there.",1
"You have many reservations. I think a unit at BU, SS23, SS24 or D will suit you better. Just be prepared to pay 50% more for older houses.",0
"Haha, you made a good guess. I'm looking at SS26 actually, but the prices are crazy.",0
when im old... should be not interested to drive and stuck in the jam... wish everything within walking distance liao.... just downstairs of my condo will do hahahah,1
similar to eco majestic park,1
"Compare Elmina west and East, overall which place better? Any idea?",1
I failed to see the relevancy here.,0
"whether west or east is better is subjective, but based on current info:the more expensive property type are launched in Elimina WestThe affordable properties from 550k to less than a 1M are launched in Elimina East ( except for corner houses with extra land )It seems the under construction park is at Elmina East - and also east is connected directly to bukit subang and denai alam.From the Guthrie corridor highway, you can turn in to Elimina East directly and shorter distance, but now this road is currently not accessible, because EV1,2,3,4 under construction.",1
"Definitely not USJ5, that's for sure. That one always boom gate down no matter what time. But USJ2 is like what u mentioned. Inconsistency...",0
Can. So you very time guard block u until police come to intervene lo. If you don't mind the cat chase affair.,0
"i also wonder why Elmina can't do this way?many phase is over million ringgit per unit in the elmina garden, it also give a bad image to the prospect buyer",0
"Yes you corrected me...thanksThe initial Elmina phases is in Elmina Gardens, and its not gated, and are higher priced landed propertieswheareas Elmina Valley will have parameter fencing with a proper guardhse in each phase - and launching prices were 500k up, smaller land area and built up",0
"I suppose all gardens and central park are opened to public, so all F&G will exclude those areas - meaning, more beautiful the park is, should expect to draw more outsider visitors.",1
So high i tot 75% or 80%? If buyer dont want to sign sdp wont sell to him?,0
"Yes, 100% consent for new F&G application (with fencing + guardhouse), 85% consent if with guardhouse only.http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/...ns-in-selangor/",1
"I would suspect a lot of early phase EG are investors, which will make it complicated to even locate them.",1

A few % rebate still $$$ ma syiok sendiri also get rebate!,1
U bought? How d billing stage now?,1
I understand 30% progress payment have to be disbursed the moment S&P stamped and loan processed.Thing is SDP is very slow on the S&P signing. Been a few weeks since my part signed and still no news on S&P being stamped. So even loan agreement cannot proceed.,1
"good lah if SDP delay, you save some progress payment and previously I paid less than 6 months progress payment before VP due to MOT payment delay therefore SDP offer 2%-5% rebate without free MOT now.",1
Plannng to buy..,1

"There multiple reason why buyers choose to go with EV vs EG. Previously, I also look arround EG before make my mind on EV. Here is the reason;1. I'm interested on Clusia. Very nice design superlink and quality finishing. But the price is more than RM 1.1 mil for intermediate. Turn me off. I rather buy smaller unit with extra land for better air flow and greenery personalization.Plus, got to prepare more money for initial buy.2. Look at Garinia. Very nice design. Price is nearly RM 900 k. Subsale, got to spend a lot of money to get the unit.3. Keana. Not my taste. Look like factory.4. EV. Decided to go with EV, 7%+2% discount. Only pay 1% and MOT. Value for money and I like the design. Very quality material. Guarded for initial 2 years by SD with perimeter fencing. Also near to matured township, Denai Alam. Feel more lively compared to EG.That is my personal opinion ya. Different people different preference.",1
"I would suggest you seek opinion from your wife or partner. My mistakes in the past have always been looking at size of house, built up, price/sqft, how much down payment, $$$$ etc. All the hard and concrete factors. My wife seem to look for view, house layout, even small things like where to hang clothes and location of washing machine. At then end, if you are looking own stay, these soft factors plays a big part in your decision. If just for investment, then just go with what seem to be the best $$$ value. I chose EV4 type A. Yes. I listen to my wife Haha.",1

Unless you like the EV3 courtyard design or 24X75 floor plan type very much. I think you should wait for EV5 or Denai Alam J1 launch towards end of the year.,0
"DA J1 is 22X70 and 22X75.I don't know the floor plan layout for EV5, most likely same as EV4.",1
"I dont really like EV3 Courtyard design, I think it is a waste of space. Without the courtyard, I can get bigger space or maybe extra room. That why Im still hesitate and looking for other places. If thats the case, I think H1 is better! cheaper and bigger. Hopefully the layout don't disappoint me",0
Prices for green will be slightly lower I guess? The design doesn't really look that good to me,0
Certainly looks like it's without roof covering.,0

western corridor go stronger now...,1
actually elmina is quite popular.. i wonder how many are investors and how many actually want to move there..,1
not sure hows the occupancy rate of those which already VP in this township.... price is kinda high for investment... and location is not really renting attraction location....,0
coz when drive around elmina garden.. alot of units are empty.. cant be ppl buy already but don't want to move in right?,0
I think when DASH highway completed that road still not yet open. Kwasa land son't have any project start now. I think they will only open when the project done.I rather use DASH if compare both.,0
Dash needs another 2 to 3 years to complete...If Persiaran Atmosfera extension done it would cut short the distance to MRT at Kwasa and Kota Damansara.,0
"he must be a investor la, not kancheong to move in.. thats why.",1
"Now SDP after restructure a lot of new staff that make me hard to follow up. They always said many defect case are waiting also, ask me wait patiently. Haha..",0
"Still, taking a year to settle all defects sounds cray-cray. Add in the time for renovations and furnishing and you're looking at a year and a half after collecting the keys before you can move in?Cannot wei.",0
That's Y now try as soon as possible lo. hahaBut good point is now more and more neighbour start move in already.Otherwise scary also if no body in the Taman.,0
If use white bricks then u will feel d heat even at night if day time its sunny n hotSdp will use red bricks 4 premium prop only,0
sure is only for premium? i tot they mix also.. unlikely they will use red bricks for the whole unit.,1
"the white one is called sand brick.the red one is called clay brick.there is hybrid of two, but rarely used in Malaysia.only recent times I notice some developers mixed two types of bricks. Before its was either clay or sand. I also noticed before clay is MOSTLY used on freehold properties and sand was on leasehold....but the distinction is less obvious now.was told sand brick is cheaper than clay brick.clay is obviously better as its more densed and less porous. but for 2s homes, I personally think that the foundation method and support beams are more important than what bricks used to build home. Unfortunately no SPA clearly stated what bricks they will use to construct yr home....so this part it is a lost battle for homeowners.",0
nt very sure but u can c from their brochures 4 d lower priced props they use white bricks,1
"am i see this correct ,, this one using red bricks? looks red to me on all sidessimedarby ev3 using whiteclay?",1
its location on quote above,1
"yea.. and im not talking about the houses, coz that cant be help and eventually some will have their own style and want to be different. But in terms of common facilities and comparing those similar conglomerate developers that build township, sime darby still have a lot to do to be the top and elmina is branded to be that kind of township but if you look at details like perimeter fencing, landscaping, concepts and even sales gallery.. they are still not as good as eco considering eco is new in the market.",0

Dont believe this guy la it looks la he's been paid. He predicted many times before there will be bubble bust (not bubble butt).No bubble bust also. You don't need to have 25 years experience to know its up to demand supply only. Demand is still there but not that strong because price is ridiculous now especially for high rise. 600psf in ulu areas for high rise surely put off investors and buyers alike.My take is that high rise will fall a little bit only. Landed continues to stable and remains the long term investment solution.,1
"denai alam is kampung style, do you need border line in kampung?it's hard for the urban netizen to understand this.",0
It is easy to understand why Malaysia's crime rate is so high until one needs to live in a G&G community to feel safe.,0
It's subject to area and most importantly personal precaution of crime.There are bungalows without F&G or G&G in the KL city area where I stay and nothing happen to them over many years.,1
"Just put a booking for EV3. Kinda worried when we move in, the place will be empty since units at left and right, and front too are still not sold... haha ðŸ˜…",0

well its true that if you working in KL... i wont suggest anyone to stay here unless u are looking for a brand new landed... and to be fair... the job opportunities nowadays are not focusing only at KL anymore... PJ subang offering alot of high income jobs as well... and MNC also alot focusing on having their offices around PJ subang.... unless u are working in a local bank or local listed co.... generally KL is not the main focus in finding job or for entertainment anymore... as an ex cheras lang... i dont like to go into KL for entertainment anymore as well...,0

land size of this phase? seems like they minimize the car porch length.... shud be bigger BU for staying in....,0
20x60bigger build uplarger than 20x70 hillpark last i checked,1
"Land size 20 x 60, BU 1709sqft. Decent BU i guess, not much to reno outside. I guess i'll be spending only on the interior. Balcony for master bedroom also very small, unlike EV2. Luckily my unit is facing the field, maybe i can park one car outside.",1
car oni mah.. u wont be driving a porsche staying in 20x70 double storey rite... just let it tanned lo,1
"frenminus the carporch of at least 200sq (20x10), internal staircases, tiny balcony......I think true BU only 1400 or 1300sq only.",0

Sure can be done as long as it fulfills the minimum required setback by the authorities,1
"5 feet for sure on car porch roof, awning is another guideline, still checking google.",0
"size and location matters... quite obvious in this case... the houses of other developer near elmina green is selling at cheaper pricing... its will be hard for them to sell at ferrea level pricing there.... see which one is your priority... budget or location... for some ppl... closer to DASH exit, mrt and towards subang.... some willing to pay more to stay closer to those amenities....",0

Auction price has nothing to do w developers price.Banks 1st need to sell at reasonable sellable price so that than can cover the loan amt and will not disadvantage to owner.Some auction property has been vped for many years jor....developers price not important anymore.,1

"Took these pictures Elmina Valley 3B around 1.5 months ago, since the showroom wasn't ready yet so we just drop by the unit next to it.* the last picture is phase EV3A, but now I guess the roof is install and a lot more clean up.",1

for me is the location and reasonable price la.... its near to damansara/bandar utama (wife office) and also thats the nearest landed house we could find at that moment...wife not prefer subsale house...so whack only lah....we did survey houses at saujana utama & puncak alam...very far and at night the road dark & scary lah,1

"oh recently only....no need to worry...will take some time for the process..few mths i guess... i started to pay the progress fee since Aug 2017, loan appved in 2016 hahahaha",1
"Ooh that late? Just asked my bank officer he said no problem with my loan, so yeah gonna take them awhile till the time i need to pay... haha",1
"my loan approved in last year, i were considering mbb, rhb and hlb. at the end i take hlb term loan at 4.3% daily rest.i remember all these 3 banks offer same rate, while mbb n rhb are fully-flexi loan, hlb is semi-flexi term loan.the reason i chose hlb is because during construction period, the advance payment can ""off-set"" the released amount. i can save more interest even during construction period.rhb only can off-set advance payment after construction.",1
How much extra you pay in advance ? and how much interests it saves ?,1
"yes, hlb loan is not fully flexi, dont hv current account to monitor advance payment.no notice required to bank in advance payment, but for withdrawal need to write in and takes time to get the fund (if not mistaken, is 30 days). rm50 charges per withdrawal.indeed, fully flexi loan is very convenience. but, hlb semi-flexi more suitable to me, as i dont hv too much in n out transaction.24mths construction period, if i save rm1k for 12 mths, i hv rm12k to buy furniture, appliances, etc",1
"Hey guys, anyone can share some main points that was discussed during the residents meet up?",1

Read a report on paultan. Talks about the progress of the DASH highway. Says that it's on schedule for completion in 2020.,1

See this :,1
"The ones you put in boxes are showing theyâ€™re in different sizes? If so, I guess itâ€™s meant to be different based on the rest - like one big pillar then small pillar...",1

please get a drone and verify it,1
White color on top surface and side surface looks different.,1
"4th row from flats, http://aeropod.myprism.biz/aero360/sdp/ev/EV2/, is the gate color for the 2 units normal ? you can view it using Windows Magnifier.If look at color in Jan/2018 pictures, this is real, http://aeropod.myprism.biz/aero360/sdp/ev/201801/EV2/",1
Dont see anything wrong either. Lol,1
"honestly, i don't think they edit much on the picture. maybe the image distorted a bit, which is expected from a 360degree view. At most, maybe they enhance the color a bit. nothing more than that.",0

"Via appointment, all you need is jut call your SA that you going to view the show room",1
is the fence between the iwk?,1
"Hi tzuen,Tq for great sharing. Fencing just between ev3 housing area and temple or the whole ev3 housing area?",1
"Yeap, saw that as well, did you went in?I were there around 9.30AM. Unfortunately the showroom is lock and there isn't any security guards or person in charge for the showroom.",0
"Agreed, should build the commercial at the same time to attract more buyer. Some people do consider nearby amenities as well.",0
"Sorry, was referring to E&O's Elmina.",1

"once elmina green connect to elmina valley, no more cramp but i'm doubt it's only open after EG VP.basically free 1 toll, so it's will be another pack road and predict the same jam effect to persiaran E1/1 (main road for saujana utama & hill park)",1
Curious about the prices of Ferrea & Liana,1
As SA told earlier EV3 whole area will come with fence and guarded. All EV3 buyers signed the security agreement for that if I'm not mistaken.,1
"if you confident with rimbayu, you wont even call it as bukit.for the same price of similar house, elmina will be better for myself.",0
"Before i decided to buy EV, i was considering bukit rimbayu too.these are few factors that i comparing these 2:- i work at PJ, so EV is nearer to me- EV is freehold, rimbayu is leasehold- for the same size/built up property, EV is cheaper (before considering any rebates)- even thought EV is difficult to get chinese foods, but not a big deal to me as i surely will have my dinner at PJ then only go home to EV- chinese schools, not a problem to me, as no children (but last yr government approved a chinese school to swift to elmina) '- environment: i buy for own stay, not investment, to me EV is more comfortable, as more ""forest""future development, not really a big concern to me. but still very excited about elmina city center.** these are just my own thoughts **",0
well... looking at SDB.... the best elmina can be flourished will be time taken for AD to flourish... lol.... anyhow... alot of things one cannot predict accurately... look at what that guy want right now better... lol,
"Bro, there is one malay cemetery reserve land in EG, i saw in the elmina master plan, if you plan to buy there, choice the house carefully...",0
any EV1 owner here? any updates on key collection?,1
I did learn a lesson owning a leasehold property before. So difficult to let go 30 years old property in the subsale market even the location is good.,0
mana dapat news? gt so many like rawang or cyberjaya or not?,1
"Been to one of the sub-sales units before, and these units facing east and west. The living room is kinda warm in the morning, and kitchen is hot in the noon. Unless you plan for 24/7 aircond.",0
Very cheap can sapu ðŸ˜ðŸ˜‰,1
"This unit is on the 2nd re-auction. First auction at 860k. First auction usually is at market valuation. But in today soft/slow market, certainly you can get cheaper price than first auction price in subsale.Will drop 10% each round until it solds.And to your statement 100k increase it is not logical. Bidder also smart. If subsale selling at 870k, nobody will bid until reaching subsale pricing.All other cost will be the same as buying from subsale. Valuation fees, legal fees and stamp duty.",1
This unit is brand new ? When VP ?,1
wow...thats good...welcoming owners...some more they are the first tenant in EV....so next EV2 people....i think EV1 and EV2 is one month gap..,1
Elmina Gardens (Aralia&Clusia) has their own WA group.,1
"I think got TM / Unifi, but no maxis or TIME, means no IPTV service available, that quite bad for TN50 vision city. So just wondering any owners raise this concern to SDP before.",0
Commercial area,1
Wow... free folding bike? Interesting... did they tell you guys will get that before buying?,1
this will be a good indication of the population there and the occupancy rate as well... if an area have low occupancy rate... no tenant wanna go in to do business for a small population....,1
.... edited,1
"not officially,i went last weekend no guard / block and can go up to EV3/EV4 roundabout",1
