Developer - sime darby property  -- I know sime darby property is not better than eco world and not the best but it not the worse. At least it able to deliver and hand over the house on time and it wont run away and become a abandon project.2. Quality - I know sime darby property didnt deliver the super quality product but at least it not the worse and the quality still can acceptable. (eg I stay in putra heights and it consider not bad compare with other deverloper). I know they should improve the qualaty but too bad they didnt.3. Location - just with 20 mins to one utama.                - near kwasa damanasara, kota damanasara, pj, ara damasara                - I got an option to use the road without paying a toll                - easy access to highway                - new highway is on the way  - DASH (not sure the 100% can build on time)                - near sg buloh MRT4. Trafic jam - which area  not jam?5. Freehold property - I have staying in leasehold and freehold property, some of u may say is the same but I have experience when I sell my leasehold condo and the price appreciation on for freehold is alway faster and higher than leasehold.6. compare with new township - elmina vs Rimbayu, ecohill, eco xxxx in kota kementing and eco xxx in syemyih, elmina is still better in term of location.7 price - pricing for new township elmina vs rimbayu, ecohill, eco xxxx kota kementing/syemyih, ecohill  in term of location, leasehold vs freehold. elmina still better.Bro @BRE , @Longshot , another PHrian spotted.","Dec 11 2015, 04:30 PM"

The aircraft continued its descent so low that it struck a hill 260 feet high, four nautical miles short of the runway. Of the total 79 passengers and crew onboard, 34 perished.Assumed CauseThe accident was caused by the captain descending below minimum descent altitude without having the runway in sight, and continuing the descent until the aircraft struck terrain four nautical miles short of the runway threshold.A subsidiary contributory factor was insufficient monitoring of the aircraft's flight path by the captain under the adverse weather conditions with several aircraft in the holding pattern awaiting their turn for approach and, more importantly, the co-pilot's failure to challenge the captain's breach of company regulations.","May 2 2016, 12:02 AM"

Elmina by Sime Darby v2,klangvalleyrookie,"Yeah, in reality it's not easy to compare 'apple to apple'. EV3C 24x75 although LA very close to Garinia 24x79 but respective BU also big difference (2626sf vs 2379).Another thing, EV3C facing north/south but Garinia facing east/west. As I know, SDP charge huge premium for north/south facing just like what they did with Garinia & Cressida or Crista 1 & 2. Again how to compare like that.A hypothetical question, if EV3C 24x75 & Garinia 24x79 both selling $880k. Which one is a better choice, EV3C with larger BU & better facing, or Garinia with extra 4ft land at the back & 'better' location?

Elmina by Sime Darby v2,dishwasher,"I went to Elmina Gardens over the weekend and liked what I saw, but having lived right smack in the middle of PJ for the past 10 years, the distance is a concern. It also feels so... deserted. I bumped into an agent and he showed me around the places, and many of the houses are still empty. According to him, these were completed in 2015. That means the area hasn't really taken off in the pass 2 years?Yes, I love nature. Yes, I find crowded areas off-putting. But I don't want to feel like a frontiersman braving the wilds. How long will it take before the area gets more populated? A bit scary to think that if anything were to happen, the closest neighbour is 5 houses away.Buying a place off the subsale market is also a concern. Agent says the warranty period is almost over, so if I buy now, renovate then move in in half a year's time, whatever defects I find will be unclaimable?

I rather buy smaller unit with extra land for better air flow and greenery personalization.Plus, got to prepare more money for initial buy.2. Look at Garinia. Very nice design. Price is nearly RM 900 k. Subsale, got to spend a lot of money to get the unit.3. Keana. Not my taste. Look like factory.4. EV. Decided to go with EV, 7%+2% discount. Only pay 1% and MOT. Value for money and I like the design. Very quality material. Guarded for initial 2 years by SD with perimeter fencing. Also near to matured township, Denai Alam.

But the water outlet remain the same and untouched. Less than 1 week later, the water in the sink flow extremely slow and in fact water came out from the other side of the bowl.The contractor came few times and showed me the experiment that when they try to drain water directly to the outlet, the water did go down, albeit very slow initially and better after 4-5 times. Then the contractor shared the theory of wrong piping design of the sink and no issue from his side.After the design change, same thing happen. But the contractor still keep insisting that nothing wrong from their side and in fact because I have change the sinki piping design, it already void the warranty.And water will flow down very very slow and really frustrating.Will like to know- If anyone face the similar issue before? ( I suspect a partial blockage in the piping that caused this)- I had raised this few times and contractors came few times but keep insisting they have nothing to do with this- What can I do now...Really appreciate if anyone can assist..","Aug 4 2017, 09:04 AM"

Elmina by Sime Darby v2,angeling79,"it was posted earlier.No offence but my personal preference is EV not EG since the location is closer to the forest & subang dam.EV 1 - too closed to the Guthrie corridor highweay, but believe is all sold out.EV 2 - nice view as is overlooking the Elmina Green, but believe all units are gone too.EV3 completed next year June nice built-up 24x75 but cons is closer to the india temple and the water tank, it is seated on a slope so the houses are looking higher than EV4.EV4 is closer to the forest but most units are gone now. the built-up is slightly smaller if u compare 24x75 w 22x75 of coz price tag is different too.SA told me no promotion at all since the project is near to completion and they not even sure will if free wifi free patrolling is part of the package deal. they will offer S&P & MOT - i guess MOT can be quite hefty.hope this helps smile.gif","Aug 17 2017, 04:22 PM"

Elmina by Sime Darby v2,fadzlie,"Buyer of EV1 for own stay here. Initially, I just jump into buying a unit EV1 because I'm tired of renting (yeah, first property). Price wise, EV1 is a bit expensive for a 20x60 house compared to other developer. I started to doubt my decision when I saw some projects 20x60 house selling for way less than EV1 price. However, during one of the buyers' engagement session I started to learn more about the township and future plans (I think this is when they initiate the EV1 RA). Boy I'm glad with my decision to buy a unit. Although EV1 is the smallest unit compared to EV2/3/4, I think it's okay for my small family. EV1 have bigger park area (I think). I love the fact that commercial area is not too near to residential area.Looking at the most recent aerial view of EV1, you can see how big the park area is (there's a full size football field there!).http://aeropod.myprism.biz/aero360/SDP/EV/EV1/index.html","Oct 11 2017, 10:04 AM"

They will try to avoid human contact and always fearing that some unkind people will catch and end their destiny.

Meaning there's no 2 storey being extended to 3 storey, or major extensions done to the houses..The roof tiles are of the same colors, the exterior walls, etc.If you go to other housing estates like kepong - you will see what I mean - even single storey becomes 2 or 3 storey and most of it - illegal extensions.

From Subang Jaya it will be far and alot of tolls but to people from Sg Buloh or Kota Damansara may not be that bad. Also depends on where you work. End of the day, one has to decide the ideal location to stay based on where they frequent.2-perhaps one needs to look at current vs future. Currently Elmina area is still not mature, hence it will feel far and isolated and not much conveniences. Give it time, these things will be sorted out. Bandar Utama used to be at the edge of the jungle and considered far away... so was Kepong and even Subang Jaya.

Maybe they have their own whatsapp group or something.My experience so far,Owner of type Type A- defects - very minimal. nothing major. ppl that bought SD before told me normally SD has a lot of defects. so this is a surprise for me.- design - the windows on the G floor is very old school. they are called ""breezy louvers window"" like our sekolah window. not really to my liking, as the window panels are easily removed. Also by the sliding door and dry kitchen door, there is a really big square window panel that i forsee will be an easy entry point for thieves.- Room - minor gripe, the master bedroom can be a little bigger, a lot of space given up to the second hall upstairs.- Natural lighting - there is plenty of it! i love it! only bedroom 1 has very minimal natural lighting.- Surrounding- there is landscape and it will grow to something even nicer with time and care. got potential!- Security - one way in, one way out by car. Im sure people can sneak in through the sides. The current security personnel is lax. They let me in even before I formally got my Keys for VP.- Freebies - 2 years TIME internet, 300mbps . And a folding bike.- Others - TNB and SYABAS weren't installed when I got my keys. told me it'll take at least 3 more weeks.- my mobile network was pretty shit when i was there.

A guard needs to be posted at the barricade while it is being used in case of emergencies, but they are not allowed to confiscate motorists‚Äô MyKad or other important documents.Residents are also not permitted to fence their neighbourhood unless it is near a highway or a drain.‚ÄúIf there is a need to fence up the area, residents will have to apply to change the land status to strata but this means all maintenance work will be their responsibility instead of the council‚Äôs,‚Äù said City Councillor Foong Saik Hoong.This also means that the community will be responsible for garbage collection and road maintenance.Aside from that, 75 percent of residents need to approve the installation of manual boom gates, but all must give their consent if they want to set-up an automated access card system.These requires high approvals as the implementation of a gated and guarded scheme among residential projects have previously resulted in fights among residents.‚ÄúThe conflict often happens with individuals who have personal agendas,‚Äù Foong added.","Sep 16 2018, 04:16 PM"
