TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"I think our post got deleted earlier by admin because we have the website link.Anyway, please let us introduce a bit about TUAI Residence.Tuai Residence is a new investment opportunity to own unique homes built suitably for rent to the our growing retiree and Ageing Malaysian market.Klang Valley has a growing population of retiree and senior citizen with aspiration for an independent, healthy and active lifestyle. In Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, we currently have an untapped market of 675,000 Ageing Malaysians above the age of 60. We are confident in our long-term outlook in the Silver Economy to provide services and products to our ageing Malaysians.Tuai Residence presents a new opportunity in a new and untapped demand within the property market. It is designed to meet the rising lifestyle and health requirement of our Ageing Malaysians.Unfortunately, many Ageing Malaysians have limited access to end financing loans to purchase a new home that is suitable for them. Here lies the opportunity for investors to acquire a sound investment in Tuai Residence Freehold Condominium that delivers a sustainable return from the long term lease to our Ageing Malaysians.Our unique value proposition to the untapped market of Ageing Malaysians also offer a strong alternative to the traditional real estate investment that is becoming saturated and over supplied in many parts of Malaysia.Thanks!","May 1 2020, 11:13 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,Ekash,"Okie, now aware that it is aiming ageing market ... will skip...","May 2 2020, 12:35 AM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"EkashThank you for sharing your frank opinion to skip this project because it is targeted at the ageing market.For clarification, the project is still open to all generations, as it is a multi generation condo.We would appreciate very much if you can share some insights as to why you would skip the ageing market.Are you looking for own stay?You don't prefer to live with many senior residents around you?The ageing market is too small to consider?Thank you!","May 2 2020, 07:50 AM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,Sorry re posting this because the earlier one in yellow highlight turned out to be hard to read.Thanks,"May 2 2020, 07:51 AM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,Ekash,"Well, imagine, if one buy for own stay, but surrounded by 80%-90% old folks, who will managed their health, their property, their payments, if suddenly they are out of luck?.. Im not saying old folks are bad, just that to community, when the ratio is too high, that's not very convincing... I would pick those normal condo where ratio might less than 25%... Perhaps just me...","May 2 2020, 08:36 AM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,bigman,"that is the concept of the development... whether end of the day there will be 80% occupied by old folks... nobody know... any way... with current cruel market competitions, developers / marketing agencies must very creative in concept... they not just selling brick and mortar... but the dream (concept) as well... for me... this concept just a marketing gimmick... since TOD, mall, SOHO, etc already saturated in the market....after this ageing concept...maybe later will come LGBT friendly concept? we never know...","May 2 2020, 12:29 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"EkashThank you for sharing your opinion.We don't think we will get as high as 90% senior residents occupying our community.We hope to create an independent active healthy lifestyle for our senior residents. Our care office and community manager are on site to provide assistance to our residents. Anyone of us, young or old can be out of luck.There are many benefit to young children to be in an environment where there are many senior residents hanging around the community during the day, especially when young parents are at work.Many articles have made research about the benefit of an intergenerational community in scandinavia, japan and closer to home, in Singapore. Younger residents can have activities with the older ones in our club house. Or simply just be in the presence of other adults for a chit chat. It can character building to have conversation with senior folks.But then of course, it is up to your preference.For some of us, they may bring in their parents to live with them in Tuai Residence.Hi Bigman, i see you point made. Fair and valid. Thank you for sharing your thought.As for us, we didn't suddenly change our concept to make marketing gimmick. Our company has been developing this product for more than a year, ever since we made our stand and vision to build suitable homes for all generations and abilities.Not any project can simply claim to be build for seniors to age in place. We have to put in many features to live up to our concept for seniors living.Our project has the following unique features:1. care office on site - trained nurse and carer on site. Community manager to organise activities.2. universal design wheel chair friendly from drop lobby all the way to one of the toilets in the condo unit3. maximum fire protection. Sprinkler inside condo. fire refuge area (to wait out fire). widened stairs for stretcher. stretcher lifts. All to keep our place safe for the young and old.4. Many communal space - clubhouse, 6 meeting rooms, multifunction room, resident lounge, communal dining, children play room5. multi sports hall - 3 indoor badminton or 1 full size basketball.6. Link bridge (traffic free and sheltered) to club house and future retail. The future retail will have many convenient amenities for our senior residents and children.many more.Please visit www.tuai.my to know more.Haha.. you are right. There are retirement villages in parts of the world made friendly for LGBT community.Thanks!","May 2 2020, 01:43 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,mingyew,For those who feel new to this kind of project.. there is a benchmark project by Ecoworld - The Parque Residence.,"May 4 2020, 09:31 AM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"MingYewThank you for sharing!Yes, we have learnt a few things from them too.For TUAI residence, we are pushing the bar higher to create a truly multi-generation homes.please let share a bit about why we call it ""multi generation homes"".That's because we are not doing a exclusive old people only development. Even the Australians are re thinking their ""exclusive old people only"" retirement village. We feel that Malaysians may skip that phase of exclusivity and move forward towards inclusive community where everyone of all generations and abilities are welcome.Thanks!","May 4 2020, 10:38 AM"

TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,darco33,Is this project inside eco Ardence?,"May 6 2020, 08:01 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"Hi Darco33Thank you for your question.Literally, Tuai Residence is located right in between Eco Ardence and Setia Alam.However, if you come from the NKVE setia alam toll, please turn left into eco ardence. Pass Ardence lab and the lake park on the left. Reach the round about, take 12 o clock, straight on for another 500m to reach our site on the left. Our site is located before the ECO Ardence entrance statement.So it does feel like we are within Eco Ardence.Our roads and landscape is connected seamlessly to Eco Ardence. So Tuai Residence is in on a Great Location and our residents get to enjoy the amenities within ECO ardence.and we are RM450/sqft. Freehold. Sounds like a good deal to you? Please register on our website.Thank!","May 6 2020, 09:00 PM"

TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,ejmaster,"Some developers do not follow showroom. Meaning what you saw may not be what you get in the future. Most smaller ones would even substitute tile quality, etc.","May 8 2020, 08:21 PM"

TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,tometoto,very nice concept. build for old people normaly very convenient for young people as well. good for own stay.,"May 9 2020, 10:17 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,JohnRothstein,"What's with all the strange building name.Also, is their target audience old people?Name sounds like for orang TUA.Their ads also mostly featuring old people.","May 9 2020, 10:41 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"Dear ejmasterWe understand your valid concern.We have asked our licensed surveyor to measure the dimensions of the walls (from center to center) and they have verified. We will be displaying their letter of verification in our show unit.As for the finishes, sometimes it is inevitable to change the finishes due to supply issue. Nevertheless, we will commit to providing the show unit tiles as much as we can. In the event we can't, we will commit to replacing them with tiles of equivalent of higher quality, specification, size and value.Thanks.Thank you! Yes, Tuai Residence is built as an inclusive community that welcome all generations, all ages and abilities!Hi JohnRothsteinYes TUAI is a unique (close association to being strange) name. It means Harvest in Malay language. Harvest is a beautiful communal celebration across many cultures. It is even a public holiday in Sarawak. In Tuai Residence, we are a building a place that sow intergenerational interactions amongst our community. We then reap happiness together.Haha.. ya. being Tua is not so bad. We create a comfortable community for our senior residents to age gracefully.There are not too many residential homes that can claim to be suitable for all ages, while most are already suitable for young residents. Hence, the emphasis in our ads to target the senior residents and families with ageing parents.On the physical appearance, the condo looks like any other condo, until we point out the features that makes it friendly for all ages and abilities.Please visit www.tuai.my to check us out! Thanks","May 10 2020, 04:35 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"One of our key feature to claim to be ""homes suitable for all generations"" is our maximum fire protection inside our condo unit and common area within the condo block.Over and above BOMBA requirement fo residential homes, we have provided fire sprinklers inside the house. Fire sprinklers are much much more effective and faster in putting out fire than to wait for the fire engine. One can youtube ""fire with and without sprinkler"" to see how a small fire become a fire ball in a just a few minutes.With such fire protection, young children, seniors and residents requiring mobility assistance is kept much much safer at home.Thank you!","May 15 2020, 12:09 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,Wiseman0514,Hi!How many units in your project?,"May 15 2020, 02:33 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"Hello wisemanThank you for your question.Tuai Residence consist of 330 units of freehold condominium. It is a very low density high rise development.Please allow us to clarify on ""low density"".Many people equate total number of units as low density. For example, one would say that 200 units is low density, regardless of land size. Some projects in KL, 200 units are built over 1 acre and therefore the density is 200 units per acre. That is rather high and common. Some of them have 9 storey tall carpark podium.For Tuai, we have 330 units over 6.6 acres. That makes our density 50 units per acre, which is relatively low for a high rise development. Because our density is low, we can put our playground and swimming pool on the ground. Trees grow much better on the ground that a concrete planter box. So landscape will be nicer (and lower maintenance too). Our carparks are spread out and our carpark podium is only 3 storey tall. Our clubhouse is on the ground level. Everything becomes friendlier and more soothing.More space for everyone. More spread out.330 units is also a good number to share maintenance cost. Not too high. Not too low.Thank you!","May 20 2020, 10:57 AM"

TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"HelloAsian type cooking may trigger smoke detectors, but they are not installed in the yard.Smoke will not trigger fire sprinklers.Thanks","May 29 2020, 10:45 PM"
TUAI RESIDENCE @ SETIA ALAM,suntrack,"Yes different market indeed.Our project1. much much lower density. Only 330 units. Carparks half on grade and half on a 3 storey tall car park podium.2. we are designed for multigeneration and multi ability. We are care office service providing support to ageing parents who may be alone at home.3. We emphasize on communal space to build a community for our young and old, with plenty of activity rooms and clubhouse. Within a low density setting, easier for community to know each other.4. We are not commercial development. Pure residential. We ONLY let residents into our development. Nevertheless, we still have a club house and future retail that is connected by a link bridge.5. We are built for raising a family. with comfortable spaces to live for much longer. Child safety is a big thing for us. we have a large fenced up playground for children to play and parents to have peace of mind.6. Indoor badminton and basketball courts.7. safety security is big for us. Anti climb perimeter fencing with CCTV along boundary. Fire sprinklers in common area and inside unit, much safer for all generations.Please pay a visit to our show gallery to experience our environment to see what we mean. The show gallery and the guardhouse forms part of the permanent building in the future. You can see your future entrance.Thank you!","May 29 2020, 11:26 PM"
