THE CRUISE @ BANDAR PUTERI PUCHONG ,yikhoe,"Which layout were you looking at? Which type?I guess the pros are amneties and location, low density and chances of rental pretty high. Cons is that its next to pavilion and not selling out as good, so growth will be slow. Also rio City will have Residences as well which means in due time it will be out of date. Pro is that if rio City is selling at highest price then you property price will increase.","Jun 16 2020, 02:10 PM"
