8,Oasis 2 @Kajang Mutiara Heights,cait_sith,"Ah, i remember you from the Oasis 1 thread. The one who comments on the water fountain roundabout at the entrance.Well, first of all, the marketing video or the brochure are only an artist impression and different people has different perception to it. That's the marketing tools used by almost all the developers these days.When choosing your ideal home, a lot of factors need to be look into before we decided to put our money into it. I definitely not going to be enticed by the marketing video or brochure. We need to look at the actual site itself and its surrounding before deciding whether to buy it or not?We need to do our own survey (developer backgrounds, location, timeline and etc.) and make that decision. If we want to own a house or home that are 100% exactly like what the developer advertised on their marketing medium, then all buyers need to wait until the project has been VPed first. If that the case, expect to pay more than the initial launch pricing.","May 8 2017, 01:04 PM"

Oasis 1 seems lower dense, but not much info given on Oasis2, so cant confirm.. they started the construction work before launch, seems good idea, help save interest...

19,Oasis 2 @Kajang Mutiara Heights,kimyao0829,"Hi, anyone here able to tell me whether there will be any high rise building will be build behind the Oasis 2? As what i saw in the site from the Saujana Height(Sort of semi-d and bungalows), there was a plenty of vacant land behind the Oasis 2. To what i concerned is what if the developer build a high rise on the vacant land, it's definitely going to affect the buyers of the Oasis 2 who going to buy for their own stay. I just raise this issue and hopefully i able to get some clarifications here. Thanks in advance and cheers","May 15 2017, 11:53 AM"

22,Oasis 2 @Kajang Mutiara Heights,kimyao0829,"Yes, same location. As what i noticed was there's indeed a construction site of the left hand side of the entrance, remaining with the vacant land on the right hand side in front of Oasis 2(as shown in my attachment). As what i saw from the board there, the developer only intended to build approximately 70 landed house, which located on the left. That why this cast my doubt whether there will be any high rise.
