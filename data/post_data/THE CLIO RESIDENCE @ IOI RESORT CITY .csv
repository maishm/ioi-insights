78,THE CLIO RESIDENCE @ IOI RESORT CITY ,blackfuzzy,"I don't think the residents would be particularly happy living with students either , since people who can afford the bigger sizes (1,388 sq. ft.) would be families, chances are. thinking back, it might turn out to be pretty much a family community, seeing that majority of the units will actually be the bigger ones.","Feb 12 2014, 02:47 PM"

86,THE CLIO RESIDENCE @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Nidz,This is true. Future owners of Clio will have to rely on the proximity of this project with the IOI City Mall as the main attraction to rent or sell.

87,THE CLIO RESIDENCE @ IOI RESORT CITY ,blackfuzzy,"In the end, Capital Appreciation will all fall back to demand. This is itself will depend in a few things.- amenities (mall, access and facilities)- the immediate neighbours / surroundings- the community (which is slightly dependent on size - smaller units aren't able to cater for families)- the environment of the townshipThis is currently reflected in Puteri Palma, where the community is quite colourful. Units are occupied by multiple nationalities, Japs, Koreans, other Asians as well as Westerners (actual owners and rentals alike).There can be many reasons why they have chosen to be located there. While they may no longer purchaser (due to to 1mil threshold), rental is still a fair possibility (rental might look even more attractive now that they can no longer purchase) since most their living expenses (rental) are probably covered by the employing organisation one way or the other.This new limitation on the minimum purchase price might actually be used to our advantage","Feb 13 2014, 05:21 PM"

118,THE CLIO RESIDENCE @ IOI RESORT CITY ,VT7,"Why insisted on ""walking"" to the mall, do you go to the mall everyday? and say if it's just 500m away from the mall, will you carry your groceries and walk all the way home or worst still the malaysian style, pushing the trolley all the way home? Unless we are comparing with services apartment built on top of the mall like Empire Subang etc otherwise it makes no differences. And I doubt they are planning to bulid any. If they really do, maybe like Soros say, RM1000/sf.The Clio is located opposite at the other parcel of development across the putrajaya gate1 highway (sounds far, yea) and Puteri Palma Condo is ""behind"" the mall (sounds much nearer right?), behind is not one road across but a 18 holes golf course. Figure out the difference and the walking distance. Tips: you are never allowed to cross the fencing and walk on the course, no bridge, no tunnel.On the other side, the site under construction now should be a mixed development having shop lots and service apartment; the clio is just adjacent to it. Take example for puchong residents and working people, do you think they will patrol the shop lots at puchong jaya / bandar puteri more of will they prefer IOI mall on daily basis? So, who is further now? The Clio or the upcoming one behind palm garden hotel?Forget about the distance, look into the product. If you want smaller size unit and more affordable purchase, clio is offering 850sf units at RM600/sf on average, counts up to be from RM500k onwards compare to the future one, if i'm not mistaken those will range above 1,000 sf. and definitely higher price say RM700? Totally different entry level.All in all, either product there are still within IOI Resort City and still good products and is depending on individual buying purposes, if for investment I personally will prefer the clio for its size, lower entry price = higher growth potential or the development next to it currently under construction. Unless if you are those considering to buy for own stay, want low density, privacy and more resort living experience like Puteri Palma Condo and you missed the boat, you don't mind waiting for the future development next to it or surrounding there despite the higher price and the bigger built up will be more suitable for own stay.","Mar 30 2014, 07:48 PM"

195,THE CLIO RESIDENCE @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Nidz,"Since I am planning to buy this project for own stay, I do not know whether it will be a wise decision for investment.But, from my observation, let's say that I decided to stay in another place when this project is finally finished. I don't think that I will have trouble in selling this unit or renting it out. My points are:1) By the time this project is completed, the shopping mall will already be in full swing. Seeing the current trends in property near shopping malls which I am familiar with, (Empire Subang, Setiawalk Puchong), this project is better located and the mall is really huge!! Biggest GSC cinema, bowling alleys, ice skating rink... and aside from the office towers, they are already planning the second phase of the mall. The total mall size will be 2.2 million sqft net lettable area. As a comparison, Mid Valley is 1.7 mil and Pavillion is 1.4 mil (Same size of the first phase of IOI City Mall).2) This project is the newest residential project in that township. The existing Puteri Palma was already sold out (except for their penthouse) and currently fetching a good rental rate at rm2k - rm3k. The buyer of this project will have the advantage of first mover in this township. Provided that all things stay the same and the property bubble doesn't burst, the developer will almost always increase the selling price of the next phase development in that township. So, I can say that these first mover will have the cost advantage of their units.3) Traffic wise, I don't think it would become a major problem even if the mall is in full swing. The reason being, IOI will be planning their traffic route in this township very carefully. I say this because this area is their HQ, and Tan Sri also lives there, in the Diamond Hill.This is my current analysis for choosing this project for my own stay. Investment wise, I really don't know how it will be in the future, but currently the signs are good. But of course, further analysis is needed.Just my 2 cents","May 24 2014, 12:46 PM"

215,THE CLIO RESIDENCE @ IOI RESORT CITY ,vinctan88,"Puteri Palma Condo owners are mostly those buying for own stay / retirement and currently, the mall and commercial area are not ready yet; massive construction on going, this might be one of the reason why the occupancy rate is lower. Since is for own stay, some would just left their units vacant and not take the hassle to rent and manage the tenants. Some will just keep it as vacation use, kinda like weekend getaway from KL city? Another reason is, the phase 3 units were built then sell, if you say 2 years ago numbers of the units are not sold / completed transaction / renovation until end of last year / early this year, the vacancy obviously has increased.The owners are good mixed of locals, more towards chinese and retired expatriate from korea, japan, vietnam, china, singapore and western country etc.Rental wise, the target market are the expats working in Cyberjaya MNCs ie Dell, AT&T, Shell, HP; Pilot & Stewardess from Air Asia, MAS, Korean Airlines, Lecturers from the international schools ie Alice Smith, Nexus, John Hopkins and also the overseas students came here for study in the international schools, together with the guardian / parents. Also, the employees around serdang, sepang and bangi industrial area.The rental rate for say 1,400 sq. ft. units can fetch around RM2,300-RM2,500 for a basic furnished unit with light fittings, fans, air con, kitchen cabinet, curtains and wardrobe. The units initially already comes with the air con, kitchen cabinets, water heater and shower screens. Whereas for a fully furnished units, the rental is around RM2,800-RM3,300 depend on type of furnishing provides. For bigger unit, may rent up to RM4,000 and units with interior design asking around RM5000-6000/month. Average return we are looking at around 4% for basic furnished and 6% for fully furnished units. (the rates are not applicable if you are buying from the subsale market now ) Subsales current transacted price at around RM550-600/sf. However, the demand >>> supply since there is still huge potential for appreciation and a lot owners are not willing to sell. Some unit sold recently mostly the few expat here previously for business purposes is now moving out from Malaysia.The same rental you may expect for The Clio residences and most likely the units will also furnished with air cons, kitchen cabinets, water heater and maybe shower screens too. If that's the case, your furnishing cost to prepare the units for rent will be very minimum. around RM10k for basic furnished units with built-in wardrobe.","Jun 3 2014, 09:55 PM"

Walking to the mall is possible, but it is around 2km (maybe, I don't know the exact distance).Both side views are nice. If facing the mall/golf course, You can also see Putrajaya and its lake. You will also see other construction/development on this side.Uniten view is more relaxed for me. The buildings are spaced apart, no visible constructions/development sites (as of yet, I don't know if this will continue in the future) you can also see the mountains area from here.I would suggest you guys to go and see the panorama view at the sales office, it is really nice.","Aug 16 2014, 07:42 PM"

""higher""; that is why so many property talks with speakers saying buy now. buy buy buy. please buy buy buy. taugeh is fresh now. please buy buy buy. buy later price is gonna be higher. but what we don't know is the developer cost structure (unless they show us before and after GST impact item by item) and their profit margin, and...how they play. a lot of factors in how they price the already high priced property. so even you buy today, you never know whether they have priced the GST inside (to have buffer for their future material costs).IMO, there is no need to rush before GST. it really depends on why you want to buy today. so i am still looking at this ioi resort city development waiting for price drop pray durian drop from sky","Aug 23 2014, 09:42 AM"

GST will be launched next year and this project will need 3 years for construction, but the contractors won't buy all the materials they need now. They will buy it in stages as well. So, any price effects due to GST must be factored in right now, or else their margins will be lower.","Aug 23 2014, 01:07 PM"

They will inform by batches.- about 20 or so units available for sale.- the lift was fast and quiet.- air con is daikin brand. I saw the Inverter sticker there.- the cooker hood is teka brand. Forgot the check the flat stove brand.- kitchen cabinets on the bottom only. Need to put cabinets on top if need more storage space.- panic button in the hall and master bedroom.- the dining + living hall is quite small for the 872sq ft condo.
