3,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Stephanie_x,any update on the location?,M
4,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Nidz,"The location will be in front of the Clio, but to the left. This will be directly beside the main road to Putrajaya, and after the flyover from IOI City Mall to Clio.If you are going to Putrajaya, you will see blue colored hoardings with Clio Residence ads. This is the site for The Connection.The concept will be retail outlets and serviced residence on top, similar to SetiaWalk or IOI's SkyPodz.Expected launching by mid of next year.",M
5,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Stephanie_x,Thanks NidzAny details on the launching of Clio?,M
6,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Nidz,"Tentatively they planned for September launching. But I spoke to the SA yesterday, he said that they are trying to bring forward the date to July or August.",M
7,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,ftan,Next year launch only?Thank you for the info.,M
8,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,TSaccetera,"The Connexion is an integrated project consisting of commercial developments and serviced apartments spreading well over 16 acres situated just next to the Clio Residences. The commercial component consists of retail outlets and offices; the retail shops range from 26’ x 70’ to 42’ x 80’ in size. The offices, on the other hand, are sized from 1,200 sq ft up to 4,220 sq ft.The residential component consists of some 1,326 serviced apartments housed in four towers, with build up ranging from 750 to 1,200 sq ft. Additionally, there will also be nine levels of parking, providing some 3,200 covered bays for tenants and guests.""",N

10,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,TSaccetera,Earthworks in progress. Next year launch.,N
11,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Babizz,"Together with par3 and CLio, how many apartments all in?",N
12,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,chicargo,,N
13,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,lamode,will this be closer to IOI city mall phase 2 as compare to Par 3 to city mall phase 1?,N
14,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,neoFluidic,How much psf?? Unit size?,N
15,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,SongSongLai,How big is this whole development?,N
16,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,ftan,I think Connextion would be closer to ioi city mall phase 2. That is assuming you buy the closest to the mall as Connextion itself is big. Clio to ioi city mall phase 2 is about 1km.I hope the mrt station will be at the ioi city mall phase 2 rather than at uniten.,N
17,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,lamode,i tot Clio was much closer...like that Connextion is a bit hard to walk to the mall if its raining/under the sun...hopefully they propose to build some walk way,N
18,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,ftan,"Clio is 2km from ioi city mall phase 1 & 1km from phase 2. Don't buy into developer story that it is walking distance. Maybe for Gwailo ok la. They happy to walk under the hot sun.There will be a bridge to connect to the mall. I believe it's possible to have free bus shuttle service to connect clio, connextion and other future developments to the mall.",N
19,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Babizz,wah 2km is dam far but if got Bridge then ok la.. i see puteri palma quite near.. btr buy subsale..,N
20,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,sosseres,"1km to phase 2 is still not consider far..., by the way,... If let say mrt line 3 that rumors will connecting to putrajaya, I guess probably the station will located the pice e if land that near phase 2. But, one more fact, if now Clio is selling 650 psf in average now, then what is the price for those future development ?",N
21,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,ftan,"It would be mrt line 2? Specifically from uniten to prestinct 14. Ok, I just googled and here's the news I was waiting for. Subject to confirmation, of course. But at least, they are lobbying for the mrt station.http://www.nst.com.my/node/55708?m=1Chong said since the mass rapid transit (MRT) alignment ends in Putrajaya, IOI Group is lobbying for future connectivity in theform of an MRT station right next to IOI City Mall.It's hard to say what the price would be for future development. My humble guess is $750 psf (but possibly developer would scoff at this). Two things would influence the pricing but I can't predict to what degree:1. Petrol subsidy removal. But only if petrol prices are up. By then, most things in general goes up.2. GST - I believe there would be a one time spike even if gov manages it well. Else expect unchecked spiraling prices, general confusion, etc.",N
22,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,ftan,I agree on this except:- don't see much subsales on puteri palma- higher entry cost- design is a bit dated,N
23,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,sosseres,"750psf is a very humble guess.. But now Clio is 650 psf in average... Well... I think everyone is waiting for township become mature.. But what is the price after mature?I just thinking if i am the investor from mont kiara, I will sell off my property with 1300psf and probably ready going into this market ...",N
24,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,sosseres,Just hearsay that owner is not willing let go their unit as the whole condo is just build by surrounding with golf course... Plus now renting to exist all the while... Especially now ioi city mall is opening ...no one lagi wanted to let go unless you are shorted of cash.,N
25,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,mybenz,How to register?,N
26,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,PeriPeri2014,This area seem is a good investment.....IOI city mall still got phase 2??,N
27,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,ftan,"My guess is for the launch of Connextion which would be next year. But I think developer would price it higher looking at IOI City Mall successful soft launch.Still a long way to go for this area to mature. The IOI City Mall is still in infancy. Hard to say what the price will be.Yes, got phase 2 and possible MRT station.",N
28,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,sosseres,Totally agreed ... Just I can't find any places in KV with such amenities plus it is just starting on development. But the current economic condition just not the right time to raise debts again ... Unless you are full of cash !,N
29,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,PeriPeri2014,For me i walk 500m consider far......2km sure die,N
30,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Babizz,if got bridge 500m also is far actually..2km loses the convenience la,N
31,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,PeriPeri2014,200M is ok for me,N
32,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,Babizz,my emira less than 20m from the AEON Can't wait for this connexion to launch,N

35,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,ftan,"By 2017 & 2018, I reckon ioi city mall phase 2 would be ready. So clio and Connextion would be 1km away only. If the mall has mrt station and shuttle service, then it would be perfect already.",F

62,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,ftan,I'm not sure. Didn't really follow on this.,S
63,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,3ton,still 50-50 to invest in this area after met few housing agents. Mostly said area still haven't mature and no mrt. They js attract potential buyers with their mall. They consider conexion as high dens. and gamble about the future return investment. If most of units hanging for sale/rent banner all the time then bye bye to investment idea. Only good for own stay. How arr?,S

68,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,PeriPeri2014,"Good project still many ppl buy even if the price is higher. Rebate higher can reduce the down payment, the investor or own stay owner need more cash in the bank for this uncertain market, for me, always higher rebate are most welcome",S

70,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,BRE,"Yes, good for investors buying 3rd prop onwards, if minimal or no rebates then difficult to come up with so much upfront cash.This Conezion nt too bad for own stay or investment as that area still dont have many residential units so it's nt crowded yet.

799,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,investor01,"Looks ok, especially for these hard times the developers cant charge too high as well.Current improvement proposal is for IOI to consider installing an additional security barrier in the lift that only allows the resident to access their floor.. surprise they are not providing as most new condos have that, the system is really not that expensive but it is so useful.As there are many units in a block, hundreds/thousands of residents can potentially access to your unit without any restriction. This is quite bad in terms of safety. With the security system installed in the lift, only residents staying in your floor will have access.Really hope IOI considers this..",O

804,CONEZION @ IOI RESORT CITY ,investor01,"i was looking forward to this property, however just checked that the price is RM 600,000 for 750sft!! Thats super expensive. The location is still putrajaya, they just a have a mall there..For that pricing, if put just 10- 15% more can get a nice condo at around KLCC area which has more malls, offices, restaurants and transport connectivity..So unless they are planning on giving a good 20% rebate...i would classify this as overpriced..Too bad..",O
